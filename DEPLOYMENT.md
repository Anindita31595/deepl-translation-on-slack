## Important Notes

✅ **This app now supports both deployment methods:**

1. **Slack Infrastructure** (Original method):
   ```bash
   slack deploy
   ```
   This deploys directly to Slack's infrastructure at no cost using serverless functions.

2. **External Hosting** (Docker/Webhook method):
   The `server.ts` file provides a webhook-based server that can be deployed to any Docker-compatible platform. This method uses Slack's Events API webhooks instead of serverless functions.

## Recommendation

**Choose based on your needs:**

- **Use `slack deploy`** if:
  - You want the simplest setup
  - You're okay with Slack-managed infrastructure
  - You don't need custom server configuration

- **Use Docker deployment** (Render, Railway, etc.) if:
  - You want more control over the hosting environment
  - You prefer using free tiers from external platforms
  - You want to customize the server setup

**For Docker deployments, Render is recommended** due to its free tier and easy Docker integration.
